            organisations. She now works in private practice with adults,
            adolescents and children. She runs self-help webinars for parents on

          <p>
            Whilst I was growing up, I went to eleven different schools in four
            countries on two continents. I discovered that they do not all work
            in the same way, and in fact, something which one school might
            regard as completely essential, another school would see as trivial
            or insignificant.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience left me with an urge to question everything which
            has never stopped. I am always asking Does it have to be this way?
            and if the answer is Yes it does, then the question is Why?
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve carried that into my career and work. I went to university
            intending to be a doctor. I had a place to study medicine and I put
            in two years of hard slog learning anatomy, physiology and
            biochemistry. Then I had the chance to do an intercalated year in
            Experimental Psychology. I quickly discovered that I found
            psychology much more interesting than medicine and haven‚Äôt looked
            back. I left medicine and went to do a PhD in developmental
            cognitive psychology (autism) at the Social, Genetic and
            Developmental Psychiatry Research Centre at the Institute of
            Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Kings College
            London. Next I did a doctorate in clinical psychology, also at Kings
            College. There, I learnt how to apply psychological theory and
            therapy to help people with their mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I completed my doctorate, I went to work in the NHS. I worked
            in primary care in Lewisham initially and then in specialist trauma
            services in London. I specialised in EMDR, a form of trauma therapy.
            I worked for the Metropolitan Police for a while. I then had my own
            children and went off on another path, that of alternative
            education.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I saw my children learning, I kept thinking about the psychology
            I had learnt ‚Äì and thinking about how the way in which many schools
            thought about learning wasn‚Äôt how a developmental psychologist
            thought about learning at all. Whilst my children did sports
            classes, I would swim up and down and try to make sense of what I
            was seeing. Those hours of thinking lead to my first book Changing
            Our Minds, published in 2021, and then the second one, A Different
            Way to Learn, published in 2023. Both are about how children can
            learn in ways which are quite different to learning at school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our choices around our children‚Äôs education led us to many different
            places (literally, we moved to France for a while and then to Hove
            and Devon), and I started to work remotely as a result. I now work
            remotely with parents and young people, as well as supervising EMDR
            therapists. I run webinars for parents and EMDR training for
            professionals. And I am in the process of writing several more
            books.

            on parent wellbeing.
