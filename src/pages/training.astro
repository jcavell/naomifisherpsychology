      <p>Naomi has been using EMDR since 2005.  She is passionate about helping others to use EMDR in a creative and responsive way.</p>

        <!--EMDR is a psychotherapy which is used to help people recover after distressed events. It can help with post-traumatic stress disorder, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and high anxiety.  EMDR is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. It is also recommended by international organisations across the globe.-->

      <p>She has used EMDR in primary care and specialist NHS settings, as well as in private practice, with the Metropolitan Police and in third sector organisations. She uses EMDR with children, adolescents and adults, and has a particular interest in reducing barriers for those who are not always able to access therapy.  She specialises in trauma, autism and neurodiversity.</p>  <p>She has been an EMDR Consultant since 2012 and an EMDR-Europe Accredited Trainer since 2023.</p>

        Naomi's training is delivered online using Zoom and break-out rooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        The course takes seven days and consists of three separate parts. It is
        a practical course and you will practise doing EMDR on each other from
        Part 1.</p>

        <p>
          You will learn how to implement the basic protocol, how to adapt that
          to your clients and how to work with complex trauma. You will also
          learn how to use EMDR as a transdiagnostic intervention. This training
          covers everything you need to start using EMDR.

        Naomi runs regular <strong>EMDR Refresher days</strong> for those who are
        already trained in EMDR but who want to refresh their knowledge. These people
        may have had some time away from clinical work, have just been on parental
        leave or might have never quite got going with EMDR.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days are online and they cover all aspects of the standard
        protocol, including cognitive interweaves. They are interactive and
        there are lots of chances to ask questions.

            You've done the EMDR basic training. You know that it could help
            your clients but you're finding it hard to get started. Maybe you
            did the training a while ago and never quite got going, or maybe
            you've recently finished but need an extra hand to get yourself up
            and running. Maybe your clients seem so complex that you just don't
            know how to try it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of the day we'll go over the 8 phases and three
            prongs of the standard protocol, troubleshoot problems and revisit
            the Adaptive Information Processing model. We'll discuss case
            formulation, dive deep into cognitive interweaves and how to use
            them address common errors and how to avoid them.
          </p>

          <p>
            All in Naomi's trademark down-to-earth and engaging style, with
            videos to demonstrate key points. You'll leave energised and ready
            to launch (or turbo-charge) your EMDR practice.
          </p>

          <p>
            All participants receive a manual, a copy of the slides and access
            to Naomi's EMDR Refresher videos for 6 months.
          </p>

          <p>
            This day is suitable for both adult and child therapists who have
            completed the EMDR basic training.
