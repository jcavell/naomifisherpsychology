      <h1>WELCOME</h1>
      <p>Here you’ll find the work of Dr Naomi Fisher and Dr Abigail Fisher.</p>
      <p>Naomi is a clinical psychologist, EMDR-Europe Accredited trainer and author of several books. Since she was a small child, she has asked the world why.  Why do things have to be this way – and what would it be like if it were different?</p>

      <p>She applies this to education, parenting and clinical psychology. She asks whether school is always the best way for children to learn, and whether the things ‘we all know’ to be true about parenting are in fact the case. She pushes for new ways to understand difference and to include voices which go unheard. Her work brings psychological theory and evidence-based practice together with real life clinical experience and open curiosity.</p>

       <p> The thread that ties her work together is her willingness to take a step outside the conventional and to challenge the status quo, even when others disagree.</p>

       <p> Abigail is an educational psychologist and qualified teacher.</p>
