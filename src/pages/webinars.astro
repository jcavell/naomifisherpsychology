  Every month I run a couple of webinars for parents. These webinars are on a
  series of topics which rotate. I started these webinars because so many
  parents were getting in touch asking for consultations or therapy and it was
  impossible for me to see them all. When I did see parents, I often ended up
  saying similar things and I thought that if I could put this into a webinar,
  then I could reach many more parents, whilst also being much more affordable
  and accessible. My aim is to communicate useful psychological concepts and
  ideas in a way which empowers parents to help their children. Each webinar
  combines theory with practical ideas and examples. I am always writing new
  webinars and if you have something which you would particularly like to see
  covered, then please do get in touch.
