      <h3>WEBINARS</h3>
      <p>
        Our live webinars for parents and professionals are hosted on Zoom. They
        combine psychological theory with practical ideas to help. They are
        recorded and available for 30 days.

          <p>
            We started these webinars because so many parents were getting in
            touch with Naomi asking for consultations or therapy and it was
            impossible for her to see them all. When she did see parents, she
            often ended up saying similar things and she thought that if we
            could put this into a webinar, then we could reach many more
            parents, whilst also being much more affordable and accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our aim is to communicate useful psychological concepts and ideas in
            a way which empowers parents to help their children. Each webinar
            combines theory with practical ideas and examples. We are always
            writing new webinars and if you have something which you would
            particularly like to see covered, then please do get in touch.
