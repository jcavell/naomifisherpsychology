      <h3>Transitions</h3>
      <p>
        Transitions are hard. You’re doing one thing, and then you have to stop
        and start doing something else. For many autistic children, this takes a
        lot of effort. Daily requirements like leaving the house or getting
        dressed are difficult – and they show us that through their behaviour.
        Life can feel like walking on eggshells. What can parents do to help?
