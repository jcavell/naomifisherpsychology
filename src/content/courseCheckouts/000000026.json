		"Your child isn’t happy at school. They are protesting in the mornings, or having meltdowns in the afternoons. They tell you that they don’t want to go, and you feel torn between them and the school. School are telling you that the answer is to keep pushing, as you don’t want to reinforce avoidance or behaviour. You feel blamed, and worry that you aren’t doing a good enough job as a parent. It’s starting to dominate everything about your family life, and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better.",
		"You don't know whether you should keep trying, or give up - and if you do, what happens then?",
		"In this course Dr Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist, will talk about what happens when a child is saying they don’t want to go to school.",
		"Naomi draws on her clinical experience to help you: ",
		"Learn about the different ways in which children show their distress and the different causes of school attendance problems. ",
		"Understand the different approaches taken by professionals and how they work (or don't work)",
		"Make decisions which put your child’s wellbeing first.",
		"You will have access to this mini-course for 6 months after purchase. ",
		"Comments from previous participants",
		"Thank you for appreciating the reality of the situation for parents. It really means a lot to know that there are professionals out there who really ‘get it’ and who are working so proactively to offer appropriate support and advocate for us.",
		"I found your presentation both hugely informative and surprisingly comforting - there is a lot to be said for knowing you are not alone, that there are people out there who understand.",
		"It was a brilliant webinar and every part of it resonated with different experiences I have had with all three of my children."
