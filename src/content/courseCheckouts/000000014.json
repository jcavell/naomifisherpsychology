		"p:There is a bewildering amount of information about autism out there, and it's very hard to know where to start. In this course, Naomi will help you understand the often confusing world of autism. She'll talk about what autism is, and the different ways in which it is now being understood. She'll go over the history so you can understand how the concept of autism has evolved and is still evolving.",
		"p:Then she'll talk about the diagnostic process, what to expect and what it means if your child does get a diagnosis (and what it means if they don't). She'll talk about the language used to talk about autism, and why this can be something which makes people angry. She'll introduce different theories of autism and touch on the controversies. She'll end by talking about neurodiversity and recommending books if you want to find out more.",

		"p:This course is suitable for parents at any stage in the process. You might be just starting to wonder if your child might be autistic, or you might be post-diagnosis and trying to make sense of it all. You might have gone through the assessment process with your child and not got a diagnosis, and be trying to work out what that means.",
		"p:This course is based on research and clinical experience. It is divided into short modules because we know how hard it is to find extended chunks of time. These are accompanied by handouts. The course will present you with information from a variety of perspectives about autism. It will help you to understand the changing landscape of autism and to form your own views.",

		"Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide. That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill. ",
		"Thank you for appreciating the reality of the situation for parents. It really means a lot to know that there are professionals out there who really ‘get it’ and who are working so proactively to offer appropriate support and advocate for us.",
		"I found your presentation both hugely informative and surprisingly comforting - there is a lot to be said for knowing you are not alone, that there are people out there who understand."
