		"Living with your autistic child is like walking on eggshells. They sleep badly, they cling to you and they have extreme reactions to seemingly small events. They are very scared of particular things, and you aren't really sure why.",
		"You worry that they are traumatised - but you don't know what to do about it, and you're not sure what actually happened to affect them like this.",
		"Naomi will explain how trauma affects the brain - and why understanding trauma in autism requires us to look beyond major traumatic events to understand the person's individual experience.",
		"Youâ€™ll leave with a better understanding of why your child reacts the way they do, and some practical ideas to help.",
		"Dr Naomi Fisher is a clinical psychologist who specialises in trauma, autism and alternative education.",
		"This course is available to watch for 6 months after purchase.",
