		"p:A cognitive interweave is when the therapist introduces new information or asks a question which is designed to help the client access information to facilitating adaptive information processing.   This short course will talk you through the process and uses role plays so you can see what it looks like in practice.",
		"p:This course covers:",
		"li:How to tell when you need a cognitive interweave.",
		"li:The four domains or themes of cognitive interweaves with examples of each.",
