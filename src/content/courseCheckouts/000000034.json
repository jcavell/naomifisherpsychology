		"p:Parenting is hard work, and this is particularly true when parenting a child with additional needs. You spend your time fighting the system for what they need and the demands can be relentless. There's never time to stop and reflect before the next crisis begin.",
		"p:Over time, this takes its toll and you start to get used to feeling chronically stressed. Even when things go well, you can't relax. You are always tired, but you can't sleep well. You don't enjoy anything anymore. You feel like life is passing you by and it's hard to take joy in anything. You can't talk to anyone else, because it feels like they are on a different planet.",
		"p:Parenthood wasn't meant to be like this. You're burnt out by the demands, and the thing is, you can't take a break from parenting. There's no option of taking some time off to recover. You can't renegotiate your hours.",
		"p:In this new course, Dr Naomi Fisher, clincial psychologist, will talk about parental burnout. What is it, might you have it and how can you start to recover, whilst continuing to meet the needs of your children?",

		"This has been the most useful thing I have had since my Son was 4 and he is now 14. Thank you.",
		"It felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.\"",
		"Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide.That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill."
