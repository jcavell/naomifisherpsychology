		"What do you do when mainstream parenting makes things worse - but you still need to live in the real world?",
		"Some children haven't read the parenting manuals. You ask them gently to have a bath and they react as if you've asked them to drink poison. You count to three and they keep right on counting. The stricter you get, the worse it seems. You worry that you're getting it all wrong.",
		"It's not your fault. You've got the wrong tools. You need low demand parenting - and that's exactly what we are talking about in this webinar. Dr Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist, and Eliza Fricker, author and illustrator, will guide you through the highs and lows of low demand parenting - and how to manage in the real world.",
		"We'll focus on siblings, sleep, hygiene and food, and we'll show you how to approach the tricky issues, separate expectations from reality and help your family to thrive. Illustrated throughout with Eliza's witty and insightful cartoons, this webinar will entertain you as well as inform you.",
		"You'll have access to this recording for 6 months after purchase.",

		"This has been the most useful thing I have had since my Son was 4 and he is now 14, thank you.",
		"What you do is invaluable to neurodivergent parents and children, and actually, for all parents and children. I’ve always maintained that so much of what is recommended for parenting and schooling autistic children actually applies to how we should treat all children."
