		"p:When are these behaviours a problem, and what do you do if they are?",
		"p:In this course, Dr Naomi Fisher will explain OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and how it can interact with autism. She'll explain how OCD happens, and how it can become more powerful, sometimes taking over a whole family. She'll describe how parents and children can fall into OCD traps, and what to do to get out. She'll give you some ideas to help your child, even if they themselves don't think that there's a problem. You'll finish the webinar with a better understanding of what is going on and how you can plan a way forwards.",

		"Your webinar was hugely reassuring and managed to provide clarity on the complex, unfathomable , frustrating times we have had as a family.
