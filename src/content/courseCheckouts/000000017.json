		"p:Demand avoidant children have an anxiety-driven need to resist the demands of every day life. In practice this can mean that they say No a lot.",
		"p:They may refuse all suggestions, or refuse to go out. They might refuse to contemplate any change to their routine, and they might also refuse to let you do things. This can make life really challenging for families.",
		"p:Lots of families get stuck, unable to change things which really need to be done differently, becuase their child responds so intensely.",
		"p:In this new course for parents, Dr Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist, will explain why demand avoidant children find change so hard, and will give you the tools to help them manage necessary changes. It will cover both intentional change (which you as the parent want to happen) and unexpected change (when something happens which is outside your control). You'll end the course with a better understanding of your child and what they find challenging, and some ideas to help them.",

		"p:\"Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide.That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill.\"",
		"p:\"This has been the most useful thing I have had since my Son was 4 and he is now 14. Thank you.\"",
		"p:\"I think it’s probably one of the most interesting, insightful sessions on anxiety in autistic children that I’ve seen. Just the initial explanation of how the anxiety develops was a real eye opener. It really helps me understand my child better.\"",
		"p:\"It felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.\"",
