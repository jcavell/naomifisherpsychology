		"Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide. That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill.",
		"It felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.",
		"I think it’s probably one of the most interesting, insightful sessions on anxiety in autistic children that I’ve seen. Just the initial explanation of how the anxiety develops was a real eye opener. It really helps me understand my child better."
