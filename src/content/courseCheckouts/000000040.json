		"p:Some children just haven't read the rule book. They meet every suggestion with a 'no' and are impervious to stickers and stars. None of your usual ideas work, and something which is a great success one week is a complete non-starter the next time. As a therapist, it's hard to know what to do.",
		"p:In this course you'll gain an understanding of what is going on for demand avoidant children and what you could do differently. You'll gain practical ideas as well as theoretical insight.",
		"p:Some of these children will have a diagnosis of autism, pathological demand avoidance (PDA) or autism with a demand avoidant profile. Others may not have a diagnosis at all. Some may be called oppositional defiant, resistant or difficult to engage.",
