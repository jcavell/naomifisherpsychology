		"p:Some children just don't respond to conventional approaches to behaviour. What do you do when the naughty step makes things worse?",
		"p:Behaviour comes up a lot in parenting. How do we get them to do this, and why won't they do this? There's a lot of advice around about how to control children's behaviour, whether that's through use of consequences, clear boundaries or even praise and approval.",
		"p:Then along come children who haven't read the parenting books. They refuse to sit on the Naughty Step, and never calm down in Time Out. The firmer their parents are, the firmer their children are in response. Family life can quickly become dominated by conflict. Parents wonder what they are doing wrong. They feel terrible. ",
		"p:You're not doing anything wrong. You've got the wrong tools. For some children, most of the techniques of mainstream parenting just don't work, and can often make things worse. You need a low demand approach.",
		"p:Dr Naomi Fisher (Clinical Psychologist and author of Changing Our Minds) and Eliza Fricker (illustrator and author of The Family Experience of PDA) will help you change the way you respond to behaviour to focus more on connection and less on conflict. ",
		"p:They'll explain why mainstream approaches aren't working, and give you some practical alternatives.",
		"p:You'll have access to this recording for 6 months after purchase.",
