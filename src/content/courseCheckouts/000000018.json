		"h3:Are you worried about screen time?",
		"p:If not, you'd be exceptional. Screen time is a hot topic in 21st century parenting. Our children are growing up in a different world to the one we lived in as children and we can feel cast adrift.",
		"p:This can be particularly difficult for parents of children for whom conventional parenting doesn't work. Those who meet gentle reminders with 'You can't force me' and for whom Time Out and the Naughty Step are simply bad jokes. Those parents set firm boundaries and find themselves fighting tooth and nail over every minute. They give up and then worry about addiction and mental health.",
		"p:In this webinar, Dr Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist, and Eliza Fricker, author, low demand parent and illustrator, will take a deep dive into screens. They'll help you understand your child's relationships with screens, and what you can do - all in a low demand way.",
