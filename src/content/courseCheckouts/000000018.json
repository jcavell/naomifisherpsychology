		"p:They are so angry - does it mean we've done something wrong?",
		"p:Many autistic children express anger in ways which surprise their parents. It's so loud, so out-of-nowhere, so extreme. Parents say it can feel like they are walking on egg shells, never sure what might set their children off. They worry that perhaps their children are terribly unhappy and it's all coming out in anger - is it something they've done wrong?",
		"p:They try to put their foot down and put boundaries in place, but it doesn't help. In fact, sometimes it seems like it's making things worse. What do you do?",
		"p:Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist will talk about why autistic children often have outbursts of anger (both external and internal), how it builds up and how to help them. She'll explain the different skills which children need to learn in order to manage their anger, and why this can be particularly hard for autistic children. She'll give you some practical tips and strategies to help your child and your family.",

		"I really appreciated your messages of hope- this is a journey and we will come out the end",
		"Your webinar was hugely reassuring and managed to provide clarity on the complex, unfathomable, frustrating times we have had as a family. It sounds a massive cliche but I felt someone finally understood what our life has been like. You showed great empathy with children and families struggling with this baffling and painful situation, coming from a place of experience",
		"Thank you so much. This was extremely helpful and validating. No one listens and no one understands. It is very isolating.",
		"Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide. That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill"
