		"Thank you so much for the wonderful webinar on managing anxiety tonight. It was just fantastic.",
		"Amazing. I can’t tell you the sheer relief and gratitude parents feel to have professionals recognise what they’ve been saying for years!",
		"I thought it was very clear how you systematically explained the reasons why anxiety develops and escalates and how to de-escalate it over time. It also felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.",
