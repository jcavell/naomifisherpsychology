		"p:This mini-course is about the preparation phase. This is phase two of the EMDR eight phase protocol, the preparation stage.",
		"li:History taking and case conceptualisation is phase 1.",
		"li:Phase 2 is the preparation phase, which I'm going to focus on in this video.",
		"li:Then we move into phase 3, the assessment phase, which is when we set up the processing",
		"li:We do phase 4, which is desensitisation. That's where we're using bilateral stimulation.",
		"li:And then we go into phases 5-8: the installation of the positive cognition, the body scan, closure and reevaluation.",
		"p:The preparation phase is one that people can sometimes be confused about. There are certain things that we always do in the preparation phase. One is the safe place. And I'll be talking about that. But the preparation phase is a hugely variable phase. It can be just maybe one or two sessions with a straightforward client who has had a single incidence of trauma perhaps, or actually it could be many months or even years if you're working with someone who's very complex.",
		"p:The point of this phase is to stabilize the client and to prepare them for processing. And that includes establishing a really strong therapeutic alliance.",
		"p:This refresher video contains 2 role plays.",
		"p:It is available to watch for 6 months after purchase."
