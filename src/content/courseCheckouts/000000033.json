		"p:Some children are very sensitive to pressure. When their parents count to three, they don't move. They don't respond to either gentle suggestions or firm boundaries. Their parents quickly feel powerless. All communication becomes conflict, with parents unsure what they are doing wrong. ",
		"p:You're not doing anything wrong. You've got the wrong tools. For some children, most of the techniques of mainstream parenting just don't work, and can often make things worse. You need a low demand approach.",
		"p:Dr Naomi Fisher (Clinical Psychologist and author of Changing Our Minds) and Eliza Fricker (illustrator and author of The Family Experience of PDA) will help you change the way your family communicates to focus more on connection and less on conflict. They'll explain why mainstream approaches aren't working, and give you some practical alternatives. ",
		"p:Eliza's original and witty illustrations will bring the whole thing to life. You'll feel a connection with other families. You will realise that you aren't alone and that there is a better way. ",
