You're trying to change your parenting style and it's hard. You feel like you've lost the tools you thought you had, but nothing has arrived to take their place. You worry that you have no influence over your child at all, and you don't know where to turn. You get that it needs to be 'low demand' - but does that really mean doing nothing? ",
