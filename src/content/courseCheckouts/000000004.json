		"p:I'm Dr. Naomi Fisher, I'm a clinical psychologist, and I specialize in autism, trauma, and alternatives in school, alternative ways to learn, and I've written two books about that.",
		"p:One of the things I noticed very quickly when I had my own children, and probably you've noticed too, is that screens are really one of the bogeymen of our age.",
		"p:They're one of the things that parents in particular are really scared of, and they're also something which you're surrounded with messages about, about how you should be behaving as a good parent around screens.",
		"p:Yet the harder parents try to put limits in place, the more  determined their children are to hold on.  It can easily become a family  flashpoint.",
		"p:In this course I talk about the screen time paradox.  I will describe the attraction that autistic children have  for screens, and how parents may be inadvertently making the situation  worse. I talk about why screens are important for many autistic  children, and how parents can help them to develop a healthy long term  relationship with technology.  I discuss how you know when things  are going wrong, and when to step in.",
