	"testimonials": [
		"Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide. That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill",
		"Thank you so much. This was extremely helpful and validating. No one listens and no one understands. It is very isolating.",
		"Your webinar was hugely reassuring and managed to provide clarity on the complex, unfathomable, frustrating times we have had as a family. It sounds a massive cliche but I felt someone finally understood what our life has been like. You showed great empathy with children and families struggling with this baffling and painful situation, coming from a place of experience",
		"I really appreciated your messages of hope- this is a journey and we will come out the end"
