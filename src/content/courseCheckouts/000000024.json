		"School has gone wrong for your child. You've spent years trying to make it work, and now it's clear that something different is required. You've found another way - but you can't move on. Your child refuses to talk about what happened, or they avoid any reminders of school. They get angry and frustrated at the slightest thing.",
		"In this mini course Naomi will talk about school trauma, how it occurs, what makes it worse and how parents can help. You'll leave with a new understanding of what has gone on for your child, why they are still affected by the past, and some ideas of what to do. This course will combine psychological theory with practical strategies and ideas.",
		"You will have access to this mini-course for 6 months after purchase. ",
