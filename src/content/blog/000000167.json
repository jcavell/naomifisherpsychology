        ".  ",
        "It’s about burnout, specifically school burnout. It takes a non-pathologising approach to teenagers experiencing burnout - the aim is that they realise they are not alone, and this isn’t going to be forever. It’s full of stories and hope. It is suitable for those with or without a diagnosis - it is neurodiversity-informed but is not limited to those who identify as being autistic or having ADHD.  It’s based on psychological principles and informed by lived experience. ",
        "It is designed for teens who find it hard to focus and who might feel hopeless about change and sceptical about books. It’s short, divided into sections and absolutely packed with Eliza’s witty and insightful cartoons. There is a chapter for parents to help you to help your teen. ",
        "For the first time it is 99p on UK Kindle for a limited time. If your teenager won’t read it, maybe you might find it helpful yourself. Please spread the word as we don’t know when it will be this affordable again. We hope you like it. ",
