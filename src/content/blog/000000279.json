        "Just as adults need to talk things through, children need to play it out.",
        "Just as adults need space to think, children need space to play.",
        "Just as adults need a break to clear their heads, children need a break to play.",
        "Just as adults need to talk to connect, children connect through play.",
        "When playtime is taken away from children because they haven’t behaved well enough, or done enough maths, or concentrated for long enough, then they don’t get the play that they need. The play that helps them to develop the skills that they need for their future. For behaviour, and maths, and concentration. The play that helps them to manage their emotions and keep themselves calm.",
        "The play that makes their life worth living.",
        "Play shouldn’t be a reward or a treat. It isn’t frivolous or a waste of time. It doesn’t make light of serious things. When children are making sense of something important, they do it through their play.  Even really terrible and difficult things which adults find hard to see. ",
        "Play shouldn’t be reserved for those who are well-behaved and who have done what they are told.  Play is what children are born to do. Play brings joy, learning and builds the foundations for the future. Play is the lifeblood of childhood.",
        "Let our children play."
