		"Here's a hack which could improve teenage mental health.",
		"Stop telling teenagers that their GCSEs are the most important thing they'll ever do and that if they don't do well, their future life will be blighted.",
		"People say this to motivate teenagers but for many it has the opposite effect. One third of teenagers are not going to do well in their GCSEs no matter how hard they work. This is how the system is designed. It's not one in which everyone can succeed.",
		"Those teenagers believe you, but many of them also know that they are not going to do well. They think, not only is my life miserable now, it's going to be like this forever. They sink into despair. They lose motivation, they become stressed and anxious - because what is the point?",
		"What can we tell them instead?",
		"That there will be second chances. That not everyone passes exams. That we will help them find their way to a rewarding future, no matter what happens in their exams. That their worth as a person is not contained in their exam results.",
		"Essentially, that there is hope for their future, no matter what."
