**Autism** is a developmental difference characterised by specific differences in social
interactions, communication and behaviour. Autistic people often also have sensory
differences, meaning that they are particularly sensitive to noise, light, texture or
taste. They often have intense interests which might be unusual. They may find it
difficult to identify and describe their emotions. A significant proportion of autistic
people will have an intellectual disability, but many will not. The autism diagnostic
category includes a very varied group of people.

Being on a different developmental trajectory can make life challenging. It can mean
that too much is expected of autistic children and teenagers without enough support
being provided. Anxiety is very common among autistic people, as are difficulties
with school and friendships.

Thatâ€™s what we talk about in our webinars and courses. They focus on practical and
useful tips which will help you to understand your autistic child and see a way ahead.
We do not do autism diagnoses. Autism should be diagnosed by a multi-disciplinary
team. This is because autism is a lifelong diagnosis and so it should be given with
great care.
