**Teenagers** are different. Puberty arrives, and everything starts to change. It’s not just about hormones and bodily changes, it’s about how their brains work. Neuroscientists now know that adolescence is a time of rapid neurological change. Teenagers start to think and react differently to younger children, and it can be really confusing for their parents. Things which used to work don’t help anymore. It’s a time of high emotions and big reactions.

Adolescence is a time of great opportunity but also vulnerability. Our teens need to look outwards and to seek new challenges and they also need us to be a safety net. They may push parents away whilst also needing to keep them close. It can be a time when some become very anxious or depressed, whilst others become burnt out and stop coming out of their bedrooms.

In my courses and webinars for this group, I talk about the changes which go on during adolescence and how parents can help their children to navigate the uncertainty and turbulence of these years.
