Most parents worry about **screens**. How much is too much, and when should they get their child a smartphone? Might the blue light be disrupting their sleep, and how do you know if they are addicted? Many autistic children, in particular, are highly attached to their screens, and parents say that they worry about what to do. 

There is a lot of fear around screens and what our children do on them. But what if the very concept of ‘screens’ is stopping us from thinking clearly? 

For a screen is just a sheet of glass. That can’t be harmful in itself.  It’s what’s happening behind the screen which matters.  ‘Screen time’ can include socialising, research, reading, playing, creating and much more.  

Our children do more via a screen than ever before, and when we put all of that together as ‘screen time’ it stops us looking more deeply.  In order to help our children develop a healthy relationship with screens, we need to look beyond the sheet of glass and ask what is really going on.
