People vary in many ways. Some find it easier to pay attention and concentration, others find it easier to socialise. Some are able to manage their emotions from an early age, whilst others need much more help for longer.  Some find it easier to learn to read and write, whilst others find that really tricky.  

**Neurodiversity** is that idea that people are different, and that these differences don’t have to be thought of as disorders. The medical model divides people up by diagnosis, giving us the impression that their brains fit into different categories.  This isn’t what the science says. 

Research shows that the differences between people are dimensional – they are a matter of increment. People don’t fit neatly into boxes. All brains are wired differently. 

People who differ significantly from the average in ways which make their life more challenging are sometimes called ‘neurodivergent’. This is often used to refer to people who are autistic, have ADHD or have dyslexia, dyspraxia or dyscalculia.
