If your child needs something a bit different at school then you may be wondering where to start and what can be done to help. You may have had meetings with the SENCO and begun to introduce some changes. The term **SEN** or Special Educational Needs covers a wider range of difficulties. It can be hard as a parent to understand what your child is struggling with at school.

About 18% of children in English schools are identified as having SEN at some point in their school career, and about 5% will have an **Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)**. This means that 1.6 million pupils in England have been identified as having SEN. These numbers have been increasing each year since 2016. According to the UK government, the most common type of need in England for those with an EHCP is autism, and for those with SEN support without an EHCP it’s speech, language and communication needs. 

These courses and webinars discuss working with school, explain how to get help and what you can expect. They also discuss specific issues and what you can do to help your child.

If you need more than school can offer, we also have courses that discuss the [EHCP process](/tags/ehcps) and how to apply.

*In Wales, the term SEN was used but since 2021 they have been transitioning to using the term ‘additional learning needs’ (ALN) instead. In Scotland, the term ‘additional support needs’ (ASN) is used.*
