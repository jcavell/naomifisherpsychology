If your child needs something a bit different at school then you may be wondering where to start and what can be done to help. You may have had meetings with the SENCO and begun to introduce some changes. The term SEN or Special Educational Needs covers a wider range of difficulties. It can be hard as a parent to understand what your child is struggling with at school.

Your child might have a diagnosis, or they might be struggling to read, or struggling with their friendships.

These courses and webinars discuss working with school, explain how to get help and what you can expect. They also discuss specific issues and what you can do to help your child. If you need more than school can offer, there are also courses which discuss the **Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)** process and how to apply. 

We are building a library of courses to help with this. Please let us know if what you are looking for isnâ€™t here.
