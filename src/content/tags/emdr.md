**EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing)** is an evidence-based psychological therapy founded by Francine Shapiro in the late 1980â€™s.  It involves identifying emotionally charged trauma memories and pairing these with bilateral stimulation, often eye movements but also tapping or tones. The distress related to the memories reduces over time, alleviating symptoms. 

EMDR  is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in adults, adolescents and children.  It can also be used to treat other mental health problems such as anxiety, phobias and depression.  It can be used with young children and those who are only minimally verbal. It can be adapted for use with those with intellectual disabilities or who are neurodivergent. 

In order to become an EMDR therapist, you must already be an accredited mental health professional and must fit the [eligibility criteria laid down by the EMDR Association](https://emdrassociation.org.uk/for-professionals/training/).
