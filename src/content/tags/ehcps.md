**Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs)** are the way to get extra support for your child in school if they need more than their school can offer. Getting a plan is a process of understanding your childâ€™s needs, having assessments and deciding what is going to help.

These courses and webinars discuss many of the common issues which parents encounter and offer tips and advice to help, based on professional experience. You will find information on **tribunals, appeals and EOTAS**.

Our content is based on knowledge and experience of the English SEN system. If you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, whilst education policy is devolved, many of the issues parents encounter are the same.

These courses and webinars are presented by **Dr Abigail Fisher**, educational psychologist. If there is anything you would like to see added, please let us know.
