Sometimes people have nothing left. They’ve been trying to keep going for years, and then it’s like they run out of juice. They don’t have any energy or spark. Resting doesn’t help, and nor does just carrying on as normal. 

This is sometimes called **burnout**. Burnout results from chronic stress, often in a workplace. When defined by the World Health Organisation, it has three main parts.  Exhaustion, feelings of negativity or cynicism, and reduced efficacy.  Burnout is not a medical problem, it’s an occupational one. It happens when a person is under chronic stress for too long.   

A growing number of teenagers and children seem to be burnout by life. They stop being able to function, they often retreat to their bedrooms, and everything seems too much.  It’s hard for their parents to know what to do.  Burnout was traditionally thought of as the result of work – but these young people seem to be burnt out by school. 

Autistic people may be particularly prone to burnout due to how stressful they find daily life, but burnout itself can be experienced by anyone.  The process of recovery is similar whether you or your child are autistic or not.   There is no evidence that autistic burnout is distinctly different to burnout.
