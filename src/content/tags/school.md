We (almost) all go to **school**, and there we learn many things. We learn that school is a good thing, and that we have to go to school in order to learn. We learn that without school, we’d get nowhere in life.

In these courses and webinars about school, Naomi talks about why school can be hard, and why some children are traumatised or burnt out by their time at school.  She’ll talk about how parents can help their children to learn and thrive, whether or not they are at school.
