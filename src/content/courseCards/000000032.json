    "description": "Parenting is hard work. You spend your time fighting the system for what they need and the demands can be relentless. There's never time to stop and reflect before the next crisis begin.\nYou're burnt out by the demands, and the thing is, you can't take a break from parenting. There's no option of taking some time off to recover. You can't renegotiate your hours.\nIn this new course, Naomi talks about what parenting burn out is, whether you might have it and how you can start to recover, whilst continuing to meet the needs of your children. It will give you some ideas as to how to start to turn things around.",
