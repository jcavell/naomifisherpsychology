    "description": "An increasing number of parents are saying that their children have 'lost their spark' and don't enjoy things in the way that they used to. They are exhausted and lacking in energy. Some of them become completely unable to attend school and stop doing things they used to be able to do.\nIn this new course, Naomi discusses burnout in children and what can parents do about it. She'll describe the factors which contribute to burnout and how parents can prevent it. She'll then move on to talking about children who are already burnt out and will give some tips for helping them to move towards recovery.",
