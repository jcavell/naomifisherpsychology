    "description": "This mini-course is for teenagers to watch themselves. When teenagers stop going to school, it can be hard to know what happens next. They’ve spent years being told that school is essential for their future, and they have no idea how to start learning without a teacher and a classroom. They feel hopeless – how can they have a future, if they don’t go to school? Featuring clips of a teenager who themselves stopped going to school in Year 9 and in a conversational and down-to-earth style, your teenager will see that they are not alone. It’s possible to learn outside school, and there are many others who have paved the way.",
