    "description": "This mini-course is for teenagers about burnout recovery for young people.\nWhen our vehicle navigates too many obstacles without enough maintenance, we start to show wear and tear. We get less able to cope with stress. We find it harder to keep calm and we're more affected by change and challenge. And sometimes we break down altogether. Naomi talks about how you can be easier on yourself, and how you can start making the first small steps to recover from burnout.",
