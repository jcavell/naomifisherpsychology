    "description": "In this short course I’ll talk you through the different stages of the Assessment phase and how they all fit together. I’ll explain what makes a good negative cognition and why the positive cognition is so important.  There are role plays so you can see what it looks like in practice – and there are a couple of interactive examples for you to use to practice spotting when things are going wrong. ",
