    "description": "Demand avoidant children have an anxiety-driven need to resist the demands of every day life. In practice this can mean that they say No a lot.\nThey may refuse all suggestion, or refuse to go out. This can make life really challenging for families.\nLots of families get stuck, unable to change things which really need to be done differently, becuase their child responds so intensely.\nNaomi explains why demand avoidant children find change so hard, and will give you the tools to help them manage necessary changes. You'll end the course with a better understanding of your child and what they find challenging, and some ideas to help them.",
