    "description": "Many autistic children express anger in ways which surprise their parents. It's so loud, so out-of-nowhere, so extreme. Parents say it can feel like they are walking on egg shells, never sure what might set their children off. They worry that perhaps their children are terribly unhappy and it's all coming out in anger - is it something they've done wrong? Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist will talk about why autistic children often have outbursts of anger (both external and internal), how it builds up and how to help them. She'll give you some practical tips and strategies to help your child and your family.",
