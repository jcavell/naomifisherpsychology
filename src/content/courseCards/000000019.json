    "description": "The preparation phase is one that people can sometimes be confused about. There are certain things that we always do in the preparation phase. One is the safe place. And I'll be talking about that. But the preparation phase is a hugely variable phase. It can be just maybe one or two sessions with a straightforward client who has had a single incidence of trauma perhaps, or actually it could be many months or even years if you're working with someone who's very complex.\nThis short course will talk you through the process and uses role plays so you can see what it looks like in practice.",
