    "description": "Some children and young people seem to withdraw from life. Their anxiety becomes so severe that anything which might have helped seemed to make things worse. They may find it hard to come out of the bedrooms or to leave the house. Parents are left not knowing what to do next.\nIn this mini-course, Naomi will help you to think about severe anxiety through the lens of the nervous system. She’ll give you some practical ideas to help your child even if they don’t want to talk about how they are feeling. ",
