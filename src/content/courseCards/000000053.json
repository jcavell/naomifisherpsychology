    "description": "When we are in the Desensitisation Phase (Phase 4) sometimes your client gets stuck and your strategies for unblocking processing just don’t seem to be enough.  This is when you need a cognitive interweave.  This is something which many newly trained EMDR therapists find extremely challenging. A cognitive interweave is when the therapist introduces new information or asks a question which is designed to help the client access information to facilitating adaptive information processing. This short course will talk you through the process and uses role plays so you can see what it looks like in practice.",
