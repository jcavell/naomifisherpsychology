    "description": "You might be just starting to wonder if your child might be autistic, or you might be post-diagnosis and trying to make sense of it all. You might have gone through the assessment process with your child and not got a diagnosis, and be trying to work out what that means. In this new course, Naomi will talk about what autism is, and the different ways in which it is now being understood. She'll introduce different theories of autism and touch on the controversies. ",
