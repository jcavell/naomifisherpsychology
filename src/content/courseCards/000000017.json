    "description": "When we are in the Desensitisation Phase (or Phase 4) of the EMDR Standard Protocol, our aim is for the client to process their trauma whilst the therapist sets things up and gets out of the way. Sometimes, however, things get stuck.  The processing isn’t flowing as we hoped, and the information isn’t becoming more adaptive.  That’s what I’m talking about in this short course. How do you know when processing is blocked, and what can you do about it?",
