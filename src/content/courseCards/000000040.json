    "description": "Many neurodivergent teens are struggling to attend school, and lots of them become completely unable to attend. But what happens next? Teenagers often believe they must be at school to learn, and that their future is over. This isn't true. We don't talk much about education outside school, but it's happening all around us. In this new course, Naomi will give you some ideas to help your teenager re-engage with learning and see a life beyond school.\nThis course focuses on the learning and educational journey, rather than mental health.",
