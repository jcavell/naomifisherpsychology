     "text": "Thanks so much Naomi. This course has helped me understand that I am seeing the symptoms of an issue with my 7 year old daughter which I need to explore further. It has also given me some great ideas that I will suggest to the school to see if it will help take the pressure off my little girl and in doing so reduce her anxiety. Thank you for sharing your experience and knowledge. ",
