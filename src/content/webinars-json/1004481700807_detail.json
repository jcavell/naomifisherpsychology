Parents get lost in a bewildering array of assessments, reports and meetings, and it's often hard to see the way forward. Join us for this illustrated webinar, which is a realistic discussion about the process, where Abigail and Eliza discuss the common issues parents encounter.</p><p>Dr Abigail Fisher is a qualified teacher and educational psychologist who has worked in local authorities, whilst Eliza Fricker (www.missingthemark.blog, author and illustrator of The Family Experience of PDA) is the parent of a child with an EHCP. Together they will guide you through the process, helping you understand what the EHCP is for, what it is meant to achieve and how you can get the best outcome for your child. Illustrated throughout with Eliza's cartoons, showing you the process from the inside.</p><p><em><em>It is recorded, please choose that option when you book. </em></em></p><p><br></p><p><strong><strong>Feedback from earlier webinars</strong></strong></p><p>Such a help to have the process explained in an understandable and digestible way!</p><p>Your knowledge is so refreshing. Thank you for raising the profile of the education system and its impact.</p><p>It was all really useful to me. I found the content and delivery easy to follow and it was helpful to hear the key issues discussed.</p>",
