The harder their parents try to get them under control, the worse things get. Consequences mount up - and nothing changes. Parents are in despair and feel that it must be their fault.</p><p>In this compassionate and down-to-earth book, Naomi and Eliza speak directly to these parents. Combining Naomi's psychological expertise with Eliza's witty illustrations and lived experience, this is a parenting book like no other. It offers parents a new insights into their child's behaviour, and practical ways to improve their family life.</p><p>Non-pathologising, relatable and easy-to-read, this is the parenting book for those for whom mainstream parenting techniques make things worse.</p><p><strong><strong>Feedback on our Art of Low Demand Parenting webinars.</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>Just wanted to thank you for another amazing webinar. You and Eliza were so generous in personal and professional experience and gave so much insight about how to navigate our parenthood journey with wonderfully made children.</em></em></p><p><em><em>So very grateful for last nights webinar.. we have literally tried everything (so I thought) Nothing seems to work. Last night everything clicked for me. The Lightbulb moments kept on coming.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Reassuring and reaffirming that it's ok to not follow traditional parenting 'norms' and there are other ways to support a pressure sensitive child</em></em></p><p><em><em>I attended the webinar last night. Things have been really tough this week. Eliza and Naomi breathed new life into my heart. Iâ€™m grateful for you both.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Such a humble, insightful and highly informative webinar. Dr Naomi Fisher and Eliza Fricker were the perfect duo of lived experience and academic knowledge. Lots to go away with to put into practice with those we work with, plus in our own home. Would highly recommend to anyone.</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>This is an invitation only event with limited capacity and so we would appreciate it if you could let us know if you are not able to attend.</strong></strong></p>",
