Dr Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist, will help you understand some of the reasons and will show you some ways you might be able to support your child. You will leave with an better understanding of what might be going on, and some ideas as to you as the parent can help.</p><p>This webinar is particularly suitable for parents of children aged from 4-12. There is another webinar focused on autistic teens which is running on Sept 23rd.</p><p>It will be recorded, please choose that option at check out.</p><p>Participants from previous webinars said:</p><p><em><em>Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide.That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill.</em></em></p><p><em><em>This has been the most useful thing I have had since my Son was 4 and he is now 14. Thank you.</em></em></p><p><em><em>I think it’s probably one of the most interesting, insightful sessions on anxiety in autistic children that I’ve seen. Just the initial explanation of how the anxiety develops was a real eye opener. It really helps me understand my child better.</em></em></p><p><em><em>I thought it was very clear how you systematically explained the reasons why anxiety develops and escalates and how to de-escalate it over time. It also felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.</em></em></p><p>Dr Naomi Fisher is a UK clinical psychologist registered with the HCPC. She specialises in trauma, autism and alternative education. She is the author of two books on self-directed education, Changing Our Minds and A Different Way to Learn. She has over 17 years clinical experience in the NHS, third sector and private practice.</p><p>This webinar is not therapy or a replacement for therapy.</p>",
