They may be told that their child needs to 'build resilience' or even 'toughen up', but this feels wrong and even punitive.</p><p>In this webinar, you'll learn how anxiety works and understand the reasons why so many autistic young people feel anxious. You'll gain an understanding of teenage brain development, and get some insight into what is going on during adolescence. You'll get some practical ideas as to how to help .</p><p>This webinar is suitable for parents of young people from the age of 11 or 12 upwards, whether diagnosed or not. It is suitable for those with a PDA profile.</p><p>You can access the recording for two weeks after this event if you choose this option at the checkout.</p><p>Participants from previous webinars said:</p><p><em><em>Thank you so much for the wonderful webinar on managing anxiety tonight. It was just fantastic.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Amazing. I can’t tell you the sheer relief and gratitude parents feel to have professionals recognise what they’ve been saying for years!</em></em></p><p><em><em>I thought it was very clear how you systematically explained the reasons why anxiety develops and escalates and how to de-escalate it over time. It also felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.</em></em></p><p><br></p><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher </strong></strong>is a clinical psychologist who is registered with the HCPC. She specialises in trauma, autism and alternative education. This webinar is not therapy and should not be used as a replacement for therapy.</p>",
