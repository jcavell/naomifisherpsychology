An innovative book that addresses mental health from a non-pathologising perspective, while promoting critical thinking about the long established medical model and health system. The book also discusses the complexities of clinical psychology and its practice encouraging critical thinking. ― Inês Mendes, Senior Lecturer, Royal Holloway University of London

An accessible and clear text that covers the key concepts and recent developments in mental health.
