    "text": "Naomi and Eliza have produced an accessible, engaging book that is a welcoming combination of personal stories, exercises and lovely illustrations that clearly addresses this common yet rarely discussed problem. The book challenges thoughts and beliefs commonly held about stress and burnout and introduces new perspectives, ideas and self-help tasks to promote effective change through a four-step process from breakdown through repair and learning to the new road ahead. The book also contains a helpful summary for parents so they can be understanding and supportive of their teens' road to change and, hopefully, recovery ",

It's not just the clear explanations of burnout and recovery that are helpful, but the way Naomi and Eliza weave in personal stories from their own and other people's lives, which makes it a warm, relatable and hopeful reading experience. You will come away understanding more about what burnout is, the factors that contribute to it and importantly, with a pathway for positive recovery. I highly recommend this book and it has a firm place on my bookshelf, as well as being on my 'recommended reading' list for young people experiencing burnout ",

She is brave in speaking the truth that we all need to hear and I really hope this book helps to bring about better recognition of burnout in teens, acceptance and support.\n\nThe book is so very relevant (sadly) to the lived experience of many our teenagers and young people having been subjected to the mainstream schools system. It's the book I wish I'd had access to 30 years ago when I was a teen & young adult struggling with the pressures and expectations of the school & college environment.",

    "text": "Well written. Highly recommended.  A great read. Received yesterday, finished in a day.\nI fully recommend that all adults that support/parents of teens and tweens read this as well as teenagers themselves. It tackles common myths around burnout as well as burnout recovery and gives well written steps that explain why the steps are beneficial and needed to the teenagers reading it.\nThere is an chapter aimed at parents included, however I would recommend the whole book is read.",

    "text": "Fantastic resource. I have only read the parent section of this book so far, it is very informative and confirms what we should be doing to support our children. Highlighting where schools and teachers are getting it so wrong and misunderstanding this condition in our teens.\nEvery school needs at least one copy of this!",
