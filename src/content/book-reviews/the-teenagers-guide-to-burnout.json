    "text": "Naomi and Eliza have produced an accessible, engaging book that is a welcoming combination of personal stories, exercises and lovely illustrations that clearly addresses this common yet rarely discussed problem. The book challenges thoughts and beliefs commonly held about stress and burnout and introduces new perspectives, ideas and self-help tasks to promote effective change through a four-step process from breakdown through repair and learning to the new road ahead. The book also contains a helpful summary for parents so they can be understanding and supportive of their teens' road to change and, hopefully, recovery ",
