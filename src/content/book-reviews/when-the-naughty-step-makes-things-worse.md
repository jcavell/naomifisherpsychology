I experienced a tremendous sense of relief and vindication after years of battling between my instincts and mainstream beliefs of reward/punishment. It is liberating to be given the green light and to realise that my gut has been right all along -- Kate, mother of two (one tween and one autistic/ADHD teenager)

Naomi and Eliza offer hope and a gentle way forward. I feel heard, like somebody understands, and they have really saved my son's life... he has a future and I see the sparkle returning -- Kirsty, mother of one

I spent years thinking I was a terrible parent, and feeling judged by all around when my son wouldn't respond to traditional 'punishment and reward' methods. But I didn't know another way. Now I do - since being introduced to Low Demand Parenting my parenting is much more effective, my relationship with my son is repaired, my whole family is much happier and, most of all, I don't feel like I'm failing him anymore -- Katie, mother of two

So many useful and practical tips... I loved the structured and clear approach and it gave me reassurance that I'm not alone (or losing my mind) as well as future hope -- Clare, parent of two

We have a houseful of hormonal teenagers and we don't fight - how weird is that? -- Louise, Essex
