            "text": "<p>School has gone wrong for your child and you worry that they're traumatised.  They may be refusing to go, or they may be avoiding particular subjects and teachers. </p><p>They get angry and frustrated at the slightest thing. They won't go near a reading book, or a playground after school. It's meaning that it isn't possible to try new opportunities or find a way forward.</p><p>In this webinar Naomi will talk about school trauma, how it occurs, what makes it worse and how parents can help. You'll leave with a new understanding of what has gone on for your child, why they are still affected by the past, and some ideas of what to do. This webinar will combine psychological theory with practical strategies and ideas. It is suitable for those with and without a diagnosis.</p><p>Dr Naomi Fisher is a clinical psychologist, author and expert in trauma and autism. She has over 19 years of clinical experience, a PhD in autism and a doctorate in clinical psychology. She is registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. Her work can be read at www.naomicfisher.substack.com or follow her as Dr Naomi Fisher on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>www.naomifisher.co.uk</p><p><em><strong><strong>Comments from participants from previous webinars</strong></strong></em></p><p><em><em>\"I really enjoyed the webinar...I've already seen a positive effect on my son's behaviour. He seems generally happier and less angry.\"</em></em></p><p><em><em>\"Brilliant webinar. You make something complex feel more understandable and give us practical strategies to take away.\"</em></em></p><p><em><em>\"Your webinar was hugely reassuring and managed to provide clarity on the complex, unfathomable , frustrating times we have had as a family. It sounds a massive cliche but I felt someone finally understood what our life has been like. You showed great empathy with children and families struggling with this baffling and painful situation, coming from a place of experience.\"</em></em></p><p>This webinar is not therapy and should not be used as a replacement for therapy. If your child is saying they want to harm themselves or others please go to your GP.</p><p><br></p>",

I feel like I've had my cup properly filled up - a first in a very long time. Our family has been in crisis for a long time now and I feel like I have completely lost myself to it. Having the well defined container of the workshop was just the support and guidance I needed. I could do with this medicine on a regular basis!</p><p><em><em>I'm not sure what I expected, but I didn't expect so much impact in such a short period of time. It was genuinely amazing to have space and useful prompts to reflect on my current emotional life and different aspects of my parenting and personal journey. I really think everyone should try the workshop... as someone who has done a fair bit of 'talk therapy', it was refreshing to have a new approach to my feelings and experiences.</em></em></p>",

In practice this can mean that they say No a lot.</p><p>They may refuse all suggestion, or refuse to go out. They might refuse to contemplate any change to their routine, and they might also refuse to let you do things. This can make life really challenging for families.</p><p>Lots of families get stuck, unable to change things which really need to be done differently, becuase their child responds so intensely.</p><p>In this webinar for parents, Dr Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist, will explain why demand avoidant children find change so hard, and will give you the tools to help them manage necessary changes. It will cover both intentional change (which you as the parent want to happen) and unexpected change (when something happens which is outside your control). You'll end the webinar with a better understanding of your child and what they find challenging, and some ideas to help them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><strong>This webinar will be recorded. </strong></strong>Please choose that option at check out if you wish to watch a recording.</p><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher</strong></strong> is a UK clinical psychologist registered with the HCPC.

Thank you.\"</p><p>\"I think it’s probably one of the most interesting, insightful sessions on anxiety in autistic children that I’ve seen. Just the initial explanation of how the anxiety develops was a real eye opener. It really helps me understand my child better.\"</p><p>\"It felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.\"</p><p><strong><strong>This webinar is not therapy nor a replacement for therapy.</strong></strong></p>",

            "text": "<p>They are so angry - does it mean we've done something wrong?</p><p>Many autistic children express anger in ways which surprise their parents. It's so loud, so out-of-nowhere, so extreme. Parents say it can feel like they are walking on egg shells, never sure what might set their children off. They worry that perhaps their children are terribly unhappy and it's all coming out in anger - is it something they've done wrong?</p><p>They try to put their foot down and put boundaries in place, but it doesn't help. In fact, sometimes it seems like it's making things worse. What do you do?</p><p>In this webinar, Naomi Fisher, clinical psychologist will talk about why autistic children often have outbursts of anger (both external and internal), how it builds up and how to help them. She'll explain the different skills which children need to learn in order to manage their anger, and why this can be particularly hard for autistic children. She'll give you some practical tips and strategies to help your child and your family.</p><p>This webinar is suitable for children with and without a diagnosis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><strong>This webinar will be recorded. </strong></strong>Please choose that option at check out if you wish to watch a recording.</p><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher</strong></strong> is a UK clinical psychologist registered with the HCPC. She has a doctorate in clinical psychology and a Phd in autism, both from Kings College London. She specialises in trauma, autism and alternative education. She is the author of several books, including <em><em>When the Naughty Step Makes Things Worse </em></em>with Eliza Fricker. She has over 18 years clinical experience in the NHS, third sector and private practice.</p><p><strong><strong>Participants from previous webinars said:</strong></strong></p><p>\"Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide.That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill.\"</p><p>\"This has been the most useful thing I have had since my Son was 4 and he is now 14. Thank you.\"</p><p>\"I think it’s probably one of the most interesting, insightful sessions on anxiety in autistic children that I’ve seen. Just the initial explanation of how the anxiety develops was a real eye opener. It really helps me understand my child better.\"</p><p>\"It felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.\"</p><p><strong><strong>This webinar is not therapy nor a replacement for therapy.</strong></strong></p>",

The strange thing really is how many of us don’t see it until our children point it out to us.</p><p>There’s the pressure to be Excited, starting in about Nov when adults ask ‘what are you getting for Christmas then?’ or even ‘Have you been good for Santa?’ (to which the right answer is a hard stare).</p><p>Then there’s the pressure of Waiting until the big day to open your gifts, even if you’d much rather have them straight away (and you don’t like big days anyway). Advent calendars are designed to rub this in, and to keep you in a frenzy of wanting to open door 24 even though it’s only Dec 2nd.</p><p>There’s the pressure to look Happy when you’re given something which you really didn’t want and didn’t ask for – but you need to ‘say thank you’ anyway (and definitely don’t tell them you want to take it back to the shop and have the money for Robux).</p><p>There’s the pressure of Joining In – everyone around the table for crackers and turkey, and no you’re not allowed to put your headphones on even if it’s too noisy. Walks in the morning or everyone watching a film together in the afternoon. Come on, just this once!</p><p>There’s the pressure of Tradition, when we do things because that’s what we’ve always done. Turkey, Christmas pudding, Christmas cake and trees, there’s really no good answer to ‘Why do we have to?’ except ‘This is what we always do’.</p><p>And when it’s all over we move onto the long and drawn out pressure of Thank you letters, that invisible obligation attached to every gift and which can cast a pall over life until at least New Year (and one memorable year in our house, until April).</p><p>Come and laugh at the art of low demand parenting at Christmas with Dr Naomi Fisher and Eliza Fricker.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><strong>Feedback from participants at our earlier webinars.</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>Such a humble, insightful and highly informative webinar. Dr Naomi Fisher and Eliza Fricker were the perfect duo of lived experience and academic knowledge. Lots to go away with to put into practice with those we work with, plus in our own home. Would highly recommend to anyone.</em></em></p><p><br></p><p><em><em>I am so grateful to you both for shining light onto what has been a very dark journey for me at times.
