Do you have battles over food, and wish that you weren't? </p><p>Do you look at other children tucking into stews and stirfries and wonder where it all went wrong? </p><p>You're not doing anything wrong. You've got the wrong tools. For some children, most of the techniques of mainstream parenting just don't work, and can often make things worse. You need a low demand approach.</p><p>Dr Naomi Fisher and Eliza Fricker will help you change the way you approach food to focus more on connection and less on conflict. They'll explain why mainstream approaches aren't working for you, and give you some practical alternatives.</p><p>Eliza's original and witty illustrations will bring the whole thing to life. You'll feel a connection with other families. You will realise that you aren't alone and that there is a better way.</p><p>WARNING: This is not a webinar on how to force your child to eat their vegetables. Look elesewhere for that. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><strong>Comments from participants from previous webinars</strong></strong></p><ul><li><em><em>Thank you both so much for this excellent webinar. It is so good to be validated in the way we are parenting our PDA child, and to be reminded of the basics and the benefits. The REACH acronym is great - I liked that you talked about these things as 'a way of being' rather than 'a set of strategies' - I think that's my biggest take home from this. I also really appreciated your real-life experiences as examples of the REACH principles. Clear, simple points on each slide, and fantastic illustrations from Eliza, as always!</em></em></li><li><em><em>Thank you for appreciating the reality of the situation for parents. It really means a lot to know that there are professionals out there who really ‘get it’ and who are working so proactively to offer appropriate support and advocate for us.</em></em></li><li><em><em>I found your presentation both hugely informative and surprisingly comforting - there is a lot to be said for knowing you are not alone, that there are people out there who understand.</em></em></li><li><em><em>This is one of the best courses I have been on. The voice of reason and over 200 parents thinking “I feel heard”.</em></em></li></ul><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher</strong></strong> is a clinical psychologist registered with the HCPC.

They may be refusing to go, or they may be avoiding particular subjects and teachers. </p><p>They get angry and frustrated at the slightest thing. They won't go near a reading book, or a playground after school. It's meaning that it isn't possible to try new opportunities or find a way forward.</p><p>In this webinar Naomi will talk about school trauma, how it occurs, what makes it worse and how parents can help. You'll leave with a new understanding of what has gone on for your child, why they are still affected by the past, and some ideas of what to do. This webinar will combine psychological theory with practical strategies and ideas. It is suitable for those with and without a diagnosis.</p><p>Dr Naomi Fisher is a clinical psychologist, author and expert in trauma and autism.

I feel like I've had my cup properly filled up - a first in a very long time. Our family has been in crisis for a long time now and I feel like I have completely lost myself to it. Having the well defined container of the workshop was just the support and guidance I needed. I could do with this medicine on a regular basis!</p><p><em><em>I'm not sure what I expected, but I didn't expect so much impact in such a short period of time. It was genuinely amazing to have space and useful prompts to reflect on my current emotional life and different aspects of my parenting and personal journey. I really think everyone should try the workshop... as someone who has done a fair bit of 'talk therapy', it was refreshing to have a new approach to my feelings and experiences.</em></em></p>",
