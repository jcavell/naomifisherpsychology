Is it extremely difficult to get them to stop doing one thing in order to start to do another?</strong></strong></p><p>Many autistic children find transitions hard - which means that their parents find them hard too. They refuse, they have meltdowns, they simply don't seem to have heard you at all. Life can feel like walking on eggshells. There are pitfalls where ever you look.</p><p>For transitions are everywhere. Each time we stop doing something and start doing something else. Each time a new person arrives or departs. Each time we go from home to school, or to visit a relative.</p><p>How can you help your autistic child with transitions? Come to the webinar to gain a new understanding of why transitions are so hard, what makes it worse - and how to help.</p><p><strong><strong>This webinar will be recorded. </strong></strong>Please choose that option at check out if you wish to watch a recording.</p><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher</strong></strong> is a UK clinical psychologist registered with the HCPC. She specialises in trauma, autism and alternative education. She is the author of two books on self-directed education, Changing Our Minds and A Different Way to Learn. She has over 17 years clinical experience in the NHS, third sector and private practice.</p><p><strong><strong>Participants from previous webinars said:</strong></strong></p><p>\"Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide.That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill.\"</p><p>\"This has been the most useful thing I have had since my Son was 4 and he is now 14. Thank you.\"</p><p>\"I think it’s probably one of the most interesting, insightful sessions on anxiety in autistic children that I’ve seen. Just the initial explanation of how the anxiety develops was a real eye opener. It really helps me understand my child better.\"</p><p>\"It felt hopeful because it pointed to a pathway out of the situation we’re in. Such a relief to have her feelings and my experience of her behaviour validated.\"</p><p><strong><strong>This webinar is not clinical advice. It is not therapy and it is not a replacement for therapy.</strong></strong></p>",

Do you feel like you are walking on eggshells?</p><p>Some children haven't read the parenting manuals. When their parents try to be firm and consistent, things don't go as they expect. They try to catch their child doing well, but then their response to praise is to say they'll never do it again. Things go very wrong, very fast.</p><p>It can leave parents feeling like no matter what they do, nothing helps.</p><p>It's not your fault. You have the wrong tools. You need to understand your child's nervous system - and work with it to help your child (and your family) thrive.</p><p>In this webinar, Dr Naomi Fisher will explain the psychology of demand avoidance. What is it, how does it affect the nervous system - and importantly, what can parents do? You'll end with a clearer idea of what is going wrong and some ideas as to how to help.</p><p>This webinar is suitable for children with and without a diagnosis.</p><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher </strong></strong>is a clinical psychologist and author. She specialises in trauma, autism and alternative appraoches to education. She is registered with the HCPC. This webinar is not therapy and should not be used as a replacement for therapy.</p><p><strong><strong>Feedback from earlier webinars</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>Your webinar was hugely reassuring and managed to provide clarity on the complex, unfathomable , frustrating times we have had as a family. It sounds a massive cliche but I felt someone finally understood what our life has been like. You showed great empathy with children and families struggling with this baffling and painful situation, coming from a place of experience.</em></em></p><p><em><em>I really appreciated your messages of hope- this is a journey and we will come out the end.</em></em></p><p><em><em>After your webinar we are more able to support our daughter, speak to her special setting confidently &amp; already supported better decision making with her needs at the centre.</em></em></p>",
