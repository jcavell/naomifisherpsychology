Do you feel like you are walking on eggshells?</p><p>Some children haven't read the parenting manuals. When their parents try to be firm and consistent, things don't go as they expect. They try to catch their child doing well, but then their response to praise is to say they'll never do it again. Things go very wrong, very fast.</p><p>It can leave parents feeling like no matter what they do, nothing helps.</p><p>It's not your fault. You have the wrong tools. You need to understand your child's nervous system - and work with it to help your child (and your family) thrive.</p><p>In this webinar, Dr Naomi Fisher will explain the psychology of demand avoidance. What is it, how does it affect the nervous system - and importantly, what can parents do? You'll end with a clearer idea of what is going wrong and some ideas as to how to help.</p><p>This webinar is suitable for children with and without a diagnosis.</p><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher </strong></strong>is a clinical psychologist and author. She specialises in trauma, autism and alternative appraoches to education. She is registered with the HCPC. This webinar is not therapy and should not be used as a replacement for therapy.</p><p><strong><strong>Feedback from earlier webinars</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>Your webinar was hugely reassuring and managed to provide clarity on the complex, unfathomable , frustrating times we have had as a family. It sounds a massive cliche but I felt someone finally understood what our life has been like. You showed great empathy with children and families struggling with this baffling and painful situation, coming from a place of experience.</em></em></p><p><em><em>I really appreciated your messages of hope- this is a journey and we will come out the end.</em></em></p><p><em><em>After your webinar we are more able to support our daughter, speak to her special setting confidently &amp; already supported better decision making with her needs at the centre.</em></em></p>",

Maybe you've read the headlines about how they are making teenagers anxious and depressed, and you just don't know how to get it right for your child.  At the same time, many teens are attached to their phones, and resist any attempt at parental control. You don't know if you should be banning phones and putting in a landline, or embracing new technology and the opportunities it brings.  </p><p>In this webinar, Naomi will unpack the reasons why parents are worried about smartphones, and she'll explain what the evidence says. She'll talk about the risks, the challenges and the benefits of helping neurodivergent teens work out their relationship with phones and screens and about what that looks like in practice. </p><p>You'll learn what to look out for, and you'll gain some ideas as to what you can do to help your teen learn to navigate the digital world whilst also prioritising their wellbeing and development.  She'll talk about how things can go wrong, and what to do then. </p><p>This webinar is suitable for children with and without diagnoses.</p><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher </strong></strong>is a clinical psychologist and author.

It sounds a massive cliche but I felt someone finally understood what our life has been like. You showed great empathy with children and families struggling with this baffling and painful situation, coming from a place of experience.</em></em></p><p><em><em>I really appreciated your messages of hope- this is a journey and we will come out the end.</em></em></p><p><br></p>",

It is so good to be validated in the way we are parenting our PDA child, and to be reminded of the basics and the benefits. The REACH acronym is great - I liked that you talked about these things as 'a way of being' rather than 'a set of strategies' - I think that's my biggest take home from this. I also really appreciated your real-life experiences as examples of the REACH principles. Clear, simple points on each slide, and fantastic illustrations from Eliza, as always!</em></em></li><li><em><em>Thank you for appreciating the reality of the situation for parents. It really means a lot to know that there are professionals out there who really ‘get it’ and who are working so proactively to offer appropriate support and advocate for us.</em></em></li><li><em><em>I found your presentation both hugely informative and surprisingly comforting - there is a lot to be said for knowing you are not alone, that there are people out there who understand.</em></em></li><li><em><em>This is one of the best courses I have been on. The voice of reason and over 200 parents thinking “I feel heard”.</em></em></li></ul><p><strong><strong>Dr Naomi Fisher</strong></strong> is a clinical psychologist registered with the HCPC.
