In the webinar, Dr Naomi Fisher will explain how trauma affects the brain, why it can be hard to recover and how parents can help their children. You'll leave with an understanding of what's going on for your child (and you) and some practical ideas for how to help. This webinar is suitable for those who have experienced different types of trauma, including medical trauma, family loss and school trauma. </p><p>Dr Naomi Fisher is a clinical psychologist who specialises in working with trauma. She is registered with the HCPC. This webinar is not therapy and should not be used as a substitute for therapy.</p><p>Participants in previous webinars have said.</p><p><em><em>Naomi's insight into children needs to be shared far and wide. That she can not only help children and families but also break down the information into easily digested bitesize nuggets illustrates her phenomenal level of understanding and skill.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Thank you so much. This was extremely helpful and validating. No one listens and no one understands. It is very isolating.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Your webinar was hugely reassuring and managed to provide clarity on the complex, unfathomable, frustrating times we have had as a family. It sounds a massive cliche but I felt someone finally understood what our life has been like. You showed great empathy with children and families struggling with this baffling and painful situation, coming from a place of experience.</em></em></p><p><em><em>I really appreciated your messages of hope- this is a journey and we will come out the end.</em></em></p><p>Naomi's website: www.naomifisher.co.uk and Substack naomicfisher.substack.com</p><p>The webinar is recorded and will be available for two weeks afterward if you choose the Recorded option at checkout.</p><p><br></p><p>Refund policy: We cannot process refunds in the last 48 hours before an event.
